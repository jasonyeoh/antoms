# AnT OMS #
This is a project that is serving following purposes for me.
  1. Spring-Hibernate-Maven-JavaEE practice
  1. Free eCommerce application, hosted on Google App Engine/Google Apps/Marketplace

Idea is simple. Use free and open source technologies. Grow you own knowledge. Build something in process to help others.

This project can be used in a private network or on cloud. Most of the requirements will come from execs of AnT (Yes! its a real company with real people, doing this work manually or via social nerwork/picasa/orkut/blogger etc.)
